# ox1dizer

- frontdoor for chromebooks
- in development, looks like it is working though
- might wipe your device, be careful
- requires WP disable
- can patch forced reinrollment (hopefully)
- you will need API keys

## building the exploit
- runs off recovery mode
- might trigger a device wipe when we swap userspace to developer mode
- you will need a linux machine and a USB drive of at least 6gb
